ANNEX 23
List of Goods for the Strengthening of Industry under Article 11a
The customs tariff heading and not the description of the goods is decisive for inclusion in Annex 23. The designation "ex" before the number 
means that only part of the customs tariff heading is covered; the description of the goods is therefore decisive for inclusion in Annex 23.
